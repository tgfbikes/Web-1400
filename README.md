# Web-1400

## Set up
#### Recommended
I highly recommend using git and furthermore having a github account.  [Github](https://github.com/) has a very extensive
[tutorial](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) on git which I highly recommend.

#### Getting the goods
Click on the 'Clone or download' button and, if you have a github account, copy the URL and paste it into your terminal with the `git clone` command.

    $ git clone git@github.com:tgfbikes/Web-1400.git

If you don't have an account (you should) you can just click the 'Download ZIP' button.  After you clone or download the files open them in your favorite editor and start hacking.
